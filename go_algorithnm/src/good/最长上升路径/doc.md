# 最长上升路径

Given an integer matrix, find the length of the longest increasing path.

From each cell, you can either move to four directions: left, right, up or down. You may NOT move diagonally or move outside of the boundary (i.e. wrap-around is not allowed).


eg.1

```text
nums = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

`res = 4`

eg.2

```text
nums = [
  [3,4,5],
  [3,2,6],
  [2,2,1]
]
```

`res = 4`
